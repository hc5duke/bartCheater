BART Cheater

If you tried to catch an eastbound train at Embarcadero around 6pm, you know how
ridiculous it can get. The way to cheat is to go the reverse direction and catch
the next train 15 minutes later at Powell or Civic Cetner. BartCheater gives you
the arrival times of trains going in both directions at stations in downtown SF.
Currently only taking Dublin/Pleasanton route into consideration.
